## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, React, React-Icons, Node

This project was built to be fully responsive through React & TailwindCSS. Each section is divided into individual components. All of these components have been styled with TailwindCSS as well as mediaq queries to be viewed on multiple devices. I also implemented smooth scrolling navigation to build a wonderful navigation experience.

## Lessons Learned:

This project has taught me a lot about styling react components. One thing I struggled with prior to rebuilding this portfolio page, was understand how to make react components responsive with media queries. I was able to familiarize myself with the process during this project. I also refreshed my memeory on how to do routing through React. Some new techniques I learned also include how to properly implement smooth scrolling. I am going to continue adding projects and polishing my knowledge and skills with new technologies and best practices.
